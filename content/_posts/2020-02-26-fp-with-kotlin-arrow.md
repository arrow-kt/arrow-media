Arrow has multiple libraries available for functional programming. In this talk we'll focus on Arrow FX and learn how to handle IO in a functional way with an introduction to monadic composition. Then we'll examine how to compose monads in a cleaner fashion with Arrow FX's monad comprehensions. Finally, we'll take a look at how to parallelize IO monads with parallel map strategies.
