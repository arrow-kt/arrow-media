Arrow Fx is a purely functional concurrency framework for Kotlinâ€™s suspend system.

In this talk, we will learn how typed functional programming and functional domain modeling powered by Arrow Optics, Fx, and Meta can be applied to assemble powerful applications and architectures from small and simple building blocks.

Simon and Raul will cover important topics and patterns such as optics, union types, refined types, type classes, automatic task cancellation, safe resource handling, and compare how Arrow Fx differs from KotlinX coroutines.
