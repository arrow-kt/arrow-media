[@msya](https://github.com/msya) explains how to use various optics and type classes in Arrow. He discusses optics such as
[`Lens`]({{ '/docs/optics/lens' | relative_url }}) and [`Iso`]({{ '/docs/optics/iso' | relative_url }}). He also goes over the purpose for type classes and how [KEEP-87](https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP/pull/87) will make it easier to implement them.
