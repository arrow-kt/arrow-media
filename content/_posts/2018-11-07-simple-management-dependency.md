In this talk we introduce the concepts of Dependency Management as a language feature, typeclasses, and a live demo of [KEEP-87](https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP/pull/87). You can follow along the example in [this folder](https://github.com/arrow-kt/arrow/tree/master/modules/docs/arrow-examples/src/test/kotlin/arrow/typeclasses).
